### SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION

This documentation will go over rules in detail for the Faust Infernium sim, as well as our weapon tiers. There are not many rules that will result in a ban, but many serves as our expectations for equipment balance in our region. While we will make an effort to avoid immediate administrative action, there are some offenses that will result in an unavoidable need for such a reaction. If you feel you have been unjustly banned, contact relevant high command within Faust in order to appeal.

Our primary enforcement method is Escalation. Usually, this is reciprocal - you pull out a Tier 2 set, we'll employ our Tier 2. However, punitive Escalation exists for rule-breakers, so please be aware of this before you begin to flaunt rules. In addition, equipment or conduct considered Tier 4 will result in administrative action.

██████████████████████████████████████████████

### SECTION 2: GENERAL RULES

These rules govern the expected conduct of all participants.

1) Excessive black-screening, intentional or otherwise, will not be tolerated. Going into the opposing designated spawn areas is prohibited.

2) Excessive flaming and generally toxic behavior will not be tolerated. We're here to have fun and shoot each other. If you're getting too invested into this and becoming angry, take a step back. If you feel a fight has turned nasty, contact the OIC and talk about ways to fix it. Both sides of a conflict should be having fun, and if one or both is not, something needs to be fixed.

3) Use of features disable by region settings (ie. flight) is strictly prohibited.

4) Non-combative personnel must declare their status. Otherwise, assume you will be shot on sight once in the combat arena.

5) Follow all instructions given by region overseers. The heat is battle is not the time to debate regulations and any disputes will be discussed once combat operations cease.  Region overseers will either declare themselves or make themselves known upon request. Anyone who is a Ringleader, Viceroy, or Field Commander is permitted to fulfill this role. NOTE: Telling region moderation to contact another person will be treated as non-compliance.

6) Keep explicit behavior and conduct off the sim. 

Infraction of these rules may result in immediate administrative action. This is your warning.

### SECTION 3: INFANTRY RULES

1) "Flashbangs" or similar blinding effects such as smoke must be reasonable. Don't include excessively loud noises or rapidly flashing colors or the like. Blinding effects may only last for 10 seconds and those that track avatars must be raycasted.

2) Grenades, Rockets, Etc...  
    2a) May not exceed a 5 meter radius.  
    2b) May not deal more than a maximum of 50 LBA to targets on a direct impact.  
    2c) May not deal more than 25 proximity LBA damage.  
    2d) Explosives without a raycast check are NOT allowed.  
    2e) Must have a 5s cooldown per explosive fired or thrown.  

3) Proximity fuses (detonates in proximity to player) are not allowed for infantry weapons. Mines must have no more than 1 HP, must detonate or destroy nearby mines, and may not linger after detonation.

4) Automatic weapons that fire explosives should not exceed a radius of 2.5 meters, RPM should not exceed 600, and explosions must deal reduced damage.

5) Seekers must comply with these guidelines: https://github.com/MalefactorIX/SLMC-Seeker-2020 . Minimum lock-on time is 2 seconds.

6) Infantry weapons may not exceed a fire-rate of 1200 RPM. Projectiles should not exceed 200m/s. Explosive projectiles (excluding vehicles) should not exceed 120m/s.

7) Ammunition per clip/magazine may not exceed 200 rounds, and reload times no less than 5 seconds for clips/magazines that exceed 100 rounds.

8) Bullet sizes may not exceed 5 meters in length and 0.05 meters in width. Tank shells or the equivalent is allowed to be up to 0.2m in width.

9) Movement enhancers (dodge rolls, dash, slides) are allowed, but may not exceed a 5 meter dash and may only occur on a 5 second cooldown. Mid-air dashing is only allowed with dedicated melee weapons.

10) Omnidirectional Jump packs and Jet packs are not allowed. We do allow a double jump (10s cooldown) or short-range boost packs with only vertical acceleration (10s cooldown after landing).

11) Enhancers or features that disable pre-jump or landing animations are disallowed. Dashes are allowed to break the landing state.

12) Grapple hooks are allowed. Avatar velocity may not exceed 5m/s and range may not exceed 30m. 10s cooldown after disengaged.

13) Weapons, either intentionally or otherwise, that kill through physics/prims are not allowed, ie. "Penetrator" rounds, or non-raycast explosives and melee attacks.
    
14) Interceptors must adhere to line-of-sight, must have a limited energy pool of no more than 15, and must have a reasonable recharge time for shots. Grenades which interfere with the intended function of interceptors are disallowed. Interceptors are to be a hard counter for grenades, having a grenade that removes that counter defeats the purpose.

15) Any lingering effect (smoke, gas, fire, flash, etc) may not exceed 10 seconds in duration. Lingering effects which have a duration that is drastically extended by region latency will be disallowed. These effects should cease if the affected target dies or enters a safe parcel.

16) All deployables, including mines or other manually placed explosives, are required to take LBA damage.

██████████████████████████████████████████████

### SECTION 4: VEHICLE RULES

1) You may have a maximum of 2 air vehicles, and 2 ground vehicles per side. Vehicles are consider Tier 2 equipment.

2) All vehicles must be destructible by LBA. Tanks are permitted to ignore collision damage, or LBA damage that is 5 or less.

3) Ground armor may not exceed 250HP for heavily armored tanks or mechs, and 125 HP for light armored units. Anything in excess of these values will be considered Tier 3. Permitted until double the listed values

4) Aerial vehicles should have the following HP Values:  
    4a) Light Craft (Fighters): Unarmored, or up to 25HP.  
    4b) Medium Craft (Gunships): Up to 100HP.  
    4c) Heavy Craft (Fleet): Up to 500HP.  
    4d) All armored aircraft may not exceed a top speed of 40m/s. Unarmored is allowed up to 80m/s.  
    4e) Anything in excess of these values will be considered Tier 3. Permitted until double the listed values.  

5) No absurdly excessive weaponry may be used in any vehicle - this is harder to quantify, so you will be informed if you need to tone things back. Use infantry guidelines as a benchmark for compliance.

6) All health systems must have an open and public github page for reference. You must be able to provide the sourcecode for your health system. Private systems will not be permitted.

7) All health systems must be at least 90% accurate regardless of region latency. Systems found to be throttling or repeatedly failing to take damage will be disallowed.

8) Maximum Combat Height for aerial vehicles is 1000m.

9) Any explosive with a radius larger than 5m must deal partial damage. The lethal radius must be reduced by 1m per meter in excess of 5m. Maximum LBA damage must also be reduced by 10 per meter in excess of 5m.  
    Easier to understand than it sounds:  
        6m = 4m Lethal, 40 Max LBA.  
        7m = 3m Lethal, 30 Max LBA.  
        8m = 2m Lethal, 20 Max LBA.  
        9m = 1m Lethal, 10 Max LBA.  
        10m = Never Lethal, No LBA.  
    Explosives larger than 10m are disallowed.  
    
10) Unarmored aircraft must have a physical hitbox representative of their size and it must contain a valid LBA description.

### SECTION 5: RAID RULES

1) There are no rules governing the declaration or prior announcement of a raid, nor are their any regulations limiting the amount of personnel you may deploy to the field. However, the attacker:defender ratio is considered when it determining the appropriate weapon tiers and types that are being deployed.

2) A group may attack once per day. Raids which persist for an excess amount of time may be terminated by the defending OIC. You can request for additional raid opportunities after your first for that day if desired. Raids are recognized as being organized efforts by at least 3 attackers for a minimum duration of 1 hour.

3) Assume things not mentioned in this ruleset are disallowed unless otherwise advised by region moderation. Even if something is disallowed, we may make a temporary exception if requested. Otherwise, such usage can be considered a Tier 3 deployment.

4) Spawn zones are clearly marked. Do not enter the opposing spawn zones. This includes being on top of said structures. You are otherwise authorized to shoot at any location you are being shot from.

5) We will attempt to identify your OiC and our OiC will make themselves known. It is expected that OiCs prioritize communication of issues over combat during any  given combat event. Repeated failure to acknowledge or refusal to follow instructions given by the defending OiC will result in revocation of this status and all offenses will be handled directly with the offender(s). You may also be disallowed from serving as oppositional OiC if this becomes a repeat issue.

██████████████████████████████████████████████

### SECTION 6: BANNED EQUIPMENT

Below is a list of equipment that may not be used under any circumstances. Use of blacklisted equipment is considered a Tier 4 deployment.

All equipment from defunct military organizations (Coercion, 2142, etc) are disallowed.  
Any object that reflects damage of any type or retaliates in similar form is disallowed.  
Any objects which restrict normal avatar movement or control are disallowed. This includes objects which stall or obstruct vehicle movement through targetted means.  
Self-regenerating health systems are disallowed.  

██████████████████████████████████████████████

### SECTION 7: HITSCAN WEAPONRY

All closed-source, agentlist-based raycast weapons will be disallowed. This includes equipment which functions in a similar principle (widecast).
They must follow all regulations which govern raycast weapons and will be subject to higher scrutiny.

[Guidelines]  
Raycast weapons are allowed, but must suffer from some form of inaccuracy or damage reduction with range and/or movement. Weapons firing in excess of 300 RPM must deal partial damage and cannot be lethal on a single-shot level. Weapons firing in excess of 600 RPM will not be permitted.
Raycast weapons will also have the open-source review requirement in cases where it is suspected of non-compliance or the distributor cannot be trusted to provide credible testimony of its function.   
Note: Hybrid Raycast rounds also must be compliant with these regulations in order to be permitted.

[If you fail compliance]  
If you believe your weapon(s) to be compliance, they can be approved by region moderation after review. Otherwise, weapons which fail to follow these guidelines will be treated similar to fully-automatic, 100% raycast weapons and use of an unsanctioned weapon will be treated as a T3 deployment of armaments. In extreme cases, it will be treated as a T4 deployment. If your weapon is considered non-compliant, you can request a review of the affected equipment and this section will be updated accordingly.

You will be notified of any non-compliant equipment should it be deemed necessary.


██████████████████████████████████████████████

### SECTION 8: TIERING AND ESCALATION

Escalation is broken down into 4 tiers. Only 3 of which are acceptable for combat.  
Tier 1: Basic Equipment - Rifles, Hand Grenades, Etc.  Basic gruntwork.

Tier 2: Advanced Technology - Raycast, Multi-Explosive Munitions, Vehicles, Light Artillery, Rockets, MGLs, Etc.  Meat and potatoes madmax romp.

Tier 3: War Crimes - Turrets, Drones, Fleet, Large Explosives/Heavy Artillery, Bussian Rias (aka Heavy Vehicles), Etc.  Popcorn is sold out.

Tier 4: Nukes, Estate Ban.
