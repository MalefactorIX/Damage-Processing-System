## Welcome
### -=Hub Areas/Landing Points/Spawns=-
All non-combat areas or areas marked as spawns are a [CEASE FIRE] area. Discharging any weapon within or into these areas with the intent to kill someone in it or from it will not be allowed.
Sitting around and shitposting will be treated as an act of hostility and will be treated the same way. Requests to remove such individuals will be granted. We have a minimum level of conduct expected of all visitors.

During combat, members of the same team/group are not permitted to intentionally engage each other. Those who do not have permission to set home in the properly marked spawn locations are not permitted to fight for that side.

### -=Major Guidelines=-
Harboring individuals who have committed offenses against these guidelines is also grounds to receive the same punishment: You being banned, without appeal, indefinitely. In addition, you will be reported for violating the SecondLife TOS where it may apply.

1. Intentionally doxxing anyone in any form is prohibited. Doxxing will be treated as the attempted release of real-world information, successful or not. The amount of data, where, or whom is irrelevant. It's a type of behavior that will not be tolerated.
2. Stealing and/or distributing another group's assets either through perm error or via malicious means (ie. Copybotting) is not tolerated. To a lesser extent, distributing stolen assets is strongly considered in nearly all cases to fall under this rule as well though at the time of writing it's nuanced.
3. Intentionally GPU and/or Sim crashing is prohibited. There have been numerous cases of this causing hardware damage for the victims. It will not be tolerated.
4. Maliciously Mass ARing (Abuse Reporting) anyone in the community. We will take action against individuals or groups attempting to use this method with falsified information. However we will not take action against individuals who's "victims" are found to have violated to the SecondLife TOS to the extent that the end result of such an action is warranted.
